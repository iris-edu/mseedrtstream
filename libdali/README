                libdali: the DataLink client library

This package contains the source code, documentation and example code
for libdali, the DataLink client library.  For further information
regarding the library interface and usage see the documentation in the
'doc' directory, including a Users Guide and man pages.

The library should work in Linux, BSD (and derivatives like macOS),
Solaris and MS-Windows environments.

For installation instructions see the INSTALL file.

-- Extras --

The 'example' directory includes an example DataLink client that uses
libdali.

The 'doc' directory includes all associated documentation including
a Users Guide and man pages for library functions.

-- Threading --

The library is thread-safe under Unix-like environments with the
condition that each connection parameter set (DLCP) is handled by a
single thread.  Thread independent logging schemes are possible.
Under Windows the library is probably not thread-safe.
